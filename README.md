# PortablePyplotStyle
This repo contains files with all the necessary rcParams to be tweaked for creating personalized styles of pyplot. You don't need to create a separate style sheet and point to the proper url or add to the matplotlib library. I personally use this for plotting scientific graphs to create proper visualization for scientific journals and readers.
